https://github.com/AFAZL/Data-structure-/blob/ede0538d84aa0a4bf83a778535571720485a5e91/array.c


|7.|Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the| ||following operations:1. Input new time  2. Display the time  3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the|| ||time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is|| ||set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.)
